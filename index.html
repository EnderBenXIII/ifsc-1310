  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibilitiy</h3>
  <p>I think Web Acessibility is important for obvious reasons. To me personally, Web Accessibility means easy to use, and making things obvious and fast. Accessibility consists of not only ease-of-use, but also means allowing those who may be disabled in someway to be able to experience the Web in the same way any normal person would. By taking the time to learn and implement different means of Accessibilitiy, it also allows us to put ourselves in other people's shoes. We ask ourselves how we can make things easier for the people that may not have things come as easily to them as they do to us, and I think that's really important.</p>
  <h3>Final Project Revision/Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    For my Final project revision, I actually asked my Mother to take a look at my version 1 of the project. To preface, I chose her because she works on a computer all day, and is on the internet pretty much 24/7, so I figured she would be willing to help point out what she looks for in a website. 1st, my initial draft really only had the homepage finished, and that was the first biggest point: "Fill out the rest of the pages, make the site feel complete rather than broken." Her only other point was that the site needed a touch more personalization. To cover these points, I (obviously) filled out the other pages with content, and added some fonts I found to give the site a bit more of a feel you would expect to find on a gaming website.
    Overall, I had a really fun time in this class, easily my favorite of the semester. Having a teacher take you through a hands-on experience such as this class truly changed my outlook on the internet as a whole. It's funny, Thomas mentioned at the beginning of this course we'd look at websites completely differently, and it's true. I see errors on pages and laugh when I know what they did wrong, and I find myself inspecting cool websites wondering how they got something to look and act the way it does, and wondering if I could replicate it. Overall, I think understood everything very well, and if I had to start over I'd want to devote more time to this class and subject.
