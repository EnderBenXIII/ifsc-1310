        <h2>What's <em>Slay the Spire?</em></h2>
        <p>
          <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a roguelike card game developed by the
          studio Mega Crit. In the game, you play as one of four characters and
          attempt to reach the top of the spire, climbing floors full of
          enemies, traps, and surprises along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          You achieve this goal with a deck of cards that you can build upon and
          upgrade on your journey to the top of the Spire. Whilst all four
          charcters start out with very similar decks, the cards and upgrades
          that become available to you vary wildly from character to character,
          allowing for unique experiences each time you play.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Gameplay in <em>Slay the Spire</em> consists of a combination of
          roguelike aspects and deck building with cards. The player selects one
          of four characters, each with their own unique starter decks and
          relics, and proceeds into the Spire. Whilst climbing floors The Player
          may encounter combats, shops, events, traps, and other such things
          that may help or hurt them as they attempt to progress further up the
          Spire.

        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>
          <em>Slay the Spire</em> was developed by the studio
          <strong>Mega Crit</strong>. Based in Seattle, the team is led by
          developers Anthony Giovannetti and Casey Yano. The goal of the game
          was to combine the roguelike style of game with deck-building card
          game aspects from games such as <em>Dominion</em>.
        </p>

        <h5>Reception</h5>
        <p>
          Upon it's initial release, <em>Slay the Spire</em> failed to meet
          launch expectations. It was not until a Chinese streamer played the
          game in front of 1.5 million viewers did the game surge in popularity.
          By March 2019, reports showed that the game had sold over 1.5 million
          copies. In regards to how streamers interact with their audience while
          playing a game, Giovannetti said
          <q>
            A streamer isn't going to be afraid to speak their minds or insult
            you - they probably don't even know you're there most of the time.
          </q>
