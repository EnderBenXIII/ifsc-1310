          <h2>The Arkansas Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Scene</h2>
      <p>Arkansas Smash Ultimate is comprised of 3 different regions that split the state. The 3 regions are as follows:</p>
      <p>Central: Geographically AR Smash's biggest region, the Central region spans all the way from Conway near the center of the state, to Magnolia and Texarkana in the south.</p>
      <p>Northwest: The Northwest region consists of the area around Forth Smith and Fayettville, and alongside Central, is one of the more active regions in AR Smash Bros.</p>
      <p>Northeast: The Northeast region is mostly comprised of the area around Jonesboro, but has been inactive for the past few years. Still, every once in a while the scene manages to come together and get an event going.</p>

          <p>The Arkansas Smash Bros. Ultimate Scene has been around since the game came out back in 2018, and has gone through multiple generations of players, with many people making a name for themselves in the scene.</p>
          <p>
            Since the pandemic, the scene has slowly been on the decline, but hopefully the scene will be able to bring some new blood in that is willing to make this scene become great again.
