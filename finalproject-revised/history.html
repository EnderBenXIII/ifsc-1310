          <h2>The History of the Scene</h2>
      <p>The Arkansas Smash Ultimate scene has been around since the game's release back in 2018</p>
      <p>When the game first came out, many of Arkansas' top Smash 4 players found themselves at the top of this new game, but after a couple years, some new faces started to pop up, and new players began making a name for themselves</p>
      <p>The pandemic brought most, if not all competition to a halt. This large break in competing caused many older players to try and find new hobbies, but it also inspired many players to swith to the world of online competing and try to make a name for themselves there.</p>
      <p>After the pandemic, many of the rising stars from before the pandemic showed up and showed out, climbing their way to the top of the rankings. Most of the older players in the scene moved on to other things and stopped competing, leading to the rise of even more young blood in the scene.</p>

          <p>The Arkansas Smash Bros. Ultimate Scene has been around since the game came out back in 2018, and has gone through multiple generations of players, with many people making a name for themselves in the scene.</p>
          <p>
            Since the pandemic, the scene has slowly been on the decline, but hopefully the scene will be able to bring some new blood in that is willing to make this scene become great again.
